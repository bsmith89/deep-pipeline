An example bioinformatics pipeline using pymake.

Dependencies:
	PyMake
	HMMER3
	getorf (an EMBOSS tool)
	pandas
	python3


Files have a consistant naming scheme:
	Any file that is downstream of a sequence file
	(whether it is a sequence file itself or not)
	will be named

		<SAMPLE>[.<FILTERS>].<TYPE>

	for instance

		'SAMPLE1.fn'

	would be the raw, unmodified nucleotide sequnce (unaligned) of
	SAMPLE1's reads.

	<FILTERS> can be a variety of things, for instance

		'SAMPLE1.fused.fq'

	would be the raw, paired-end reads from SAMPLE1 fused together
	across their overlap to make a FASTQ formatted file (nucleotide).

		'SAMPLE2.fused.orf30.fa'
	
	would be the fused reads from SAMPLE2, run through an ORF finder with
	a minimum length of 30 resulting in a FASTA formatted file of amino-acid
	sequences. (The ORF sequences, as it turns out, will have the same read
	names as their source reads, but with '(START-END)' appended to the end to
	indicate the coordinates in nucleotide space which defines the ORF.

		'SAMPLE1.fused.orf30.TIGR02376.hmmsearch_out'
	
	is the hmmsearch tabular output file (with all '# Comments' removed) for
	SAMPLE1, processed as described above and searched against the TIGR02376
	profile-HMM.

		'SAMPLE1.fused.orf30.TIGR02376.fn'

	Are the nucleotide sequences of the ORFs which hit TIGR02376 from SAMPLE1.

	As you can see, we can parse out a "middle" portion which is just the
	filtering, and an optional penultimate item, which is the model, followed
	by the extension which indicates what type of data is contained in the
	file.
